==================
Sake Documentation
==================

`Sake`_ is a C# language enabled make system and is used to build the projects that comprise the `ASP.NET 5`_ stack.  Sake uses a custom build of the Spark view engine, and additional insight into working with Sake can be gained from reviewing `Spark`_.

.. note:: I pronounce "Sake" as rhyming with "make".  This seems to make the most sense, whether you consider "Sake" to be a blend of "CS make", or "Spark make", and it avoids confusion when discussing it along with psake (PowerShell make), which is pronounced as the Japanese rice wine.

.. note:: Sake was created by Louis DeJardin.  I was not a contributor to the Sake project, and this documentation is based on trial and error, review of the Sake source code and Spark documentation, and looking at Sake's use in the ASP.NET 5 projects. 

.. seealso:: Source code for the samples is `available on github`_.
